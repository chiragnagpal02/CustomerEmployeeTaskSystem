# CRM System

During my internship at Siemens, my team member and I worked on this Customer Relationship Management System (CRM), extensively designed by using Python, Django, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and SQLlite as the database. 

The Managers of the Team needed a way to allot tasks to their designated employee teams, while also managing and updating the exixting tasks and their respective timelines. 

The system is capable of handling more than 20,000 customers for the company and can do extensive compuations in the backend helping save valuable time for the managers which results in increased productivity.

Clicking on any of the above buttons will give us the table of records directly from the database!

We used a NewsAPI tool to get all the live updates of the news in a Marquee Form!

Finally, we had created Bootstrap forms for the storing of data.
